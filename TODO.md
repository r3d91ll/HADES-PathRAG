## Priority #1: ISNE Implementation

### ISNE Implementation Plan Overview

After a review of the initial implementation and the original research paper, we've decided to proceed with a complete rewrite of the ISNE module to more accurately reflect the authors' methodology. This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing ISNE as documented in the [original paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40747-024-01545-6)

### Core Components

- [x] Create isne_readme.md in the root of the module directory to track documentation
- [ ] Set up PyTorch Geometric integration for efficient graph operations
- [ ] Implement ISNE layer architecture precisely matching the paper's methodology
- [ ] Create specialized loss functions for structure and feature preservation
- [ ] Develop training framework with proper neighborhood sampling
- [ ] Implement evaluation metrics for model validation
- [ ] Build direct pipeline integration rather than file-based loading

### Pipeline Integration

After examining the current pipeline architecture, we've determined that the ISNE module should integrate directly with the existing data flow rather than relying on file-based loading. Key points:

- The existing pipeline (docproc → chunking → embedding) already maintains data in memory
- File writes only occur in debug mode or when explicitly requested
- ISNE should continue this pattern by accepting data directly from the embedding pipeline
- The `modernbert_loader.py` will be maintained only for offline processing and troubleshooting
- This approach eliminates unnecessary serialization/deserialization and improves performance
