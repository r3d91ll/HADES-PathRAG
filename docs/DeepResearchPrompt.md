## Deep Research Prompt

*“Using the HADES-PathRAG architecture documentation as our blueprint, compare it to the existing codebase at [GitHub link: `feature/mcp-interface` branch]. Please identify the major differences between the actual implementation and the documented design, focusing on MCP, ISNE, PathRAG retrieval, ArangoDB usage, and code/text modalities. Provide a detailed, prioritized plan to reconcile these gaps, with steps, dependencies, and any recommended simplifications for a local POC. Summarize how we should test and validate each step to ensure the code aligns with the architecture and remains maintainable in the future.”*

**Context:**

- We have a **target architecture** for HADES-PathRAG documented in detail (covering MCP integration, ISNE embeddings, PathRAG retrieval, ArangoDB usage, branch-aware Git workflows, etc.).
- We have an **existing codebase** at [HADES-PathRAG: feature/mcp-interface branch](https://github.com/r3d91ll/HADES-PathRAG/tree/feature/mcp-interface).
- Our goal is to **compare** the current implementation to the planned architecture and develop a **step-by-step plan** (or roadmap) for bringing the code into alignment with the documented design.

**Prompt Instructions:**

1. **Document Analysis**  
   - Review the **architecture document** (the one detailing the MCP server, ISNE embeddings, PathRAG retrieval, ArangoDB integration, dual modality handling, recursive development approach, etc.).  
   - Summarize the major components, key features, and intended workflows.

2. **Codebase Review**  
   - Examine the code in the [`feature/mcp-interface` branch](https://github.com/r3d91ll/HADES-PathRAG/tree/feature/mcp-interface).  
   - Identify what is already implemented, partially implemented, or missing, especially with respect to:
     - MCP Server functionality
     - Graph-based retrieval (PathRAG)
     - ISNE or other embedding pipelines
     - ArangoDB usage and data models
     - Dual modality (code vs. text)
     - Git branch-awareness and versioning
     - Self-referential indexing (recursive development concept)

3. **Gap Analysis**  
   - For each major section in the architecture document, note how the **current code** matches or deviates from the **intended design**.  
   - Highlight any **missing features** or incomplete functionalities.  
   - Point out any **structural differences** (e.g., if a different database is used or if certain modules don’t align with the doc’s layering).

4. **Actionable Roadmap**  
   - Propose a **detailed sequence of implementation steps** to move from the existing state to the target architecture.  
   - For each step, specify:
     - **Goal** (which part of the architecture doc it addresses)
     - **Actions** (code changes, refactors, new modules/classes)
     - **Dependencies** (which steps or modules must be completed first)
     - **Complexity or Effort** estimates (if relevant)
   - Where possible, **prioritize** tasks (e.g., “High priority,” “Nice-to-have,” “Experimental”).

5. **Potential Simplifications**  
   - Since this is a local proof-of-concept, suggest any **features or optimizations** from the architecture doc that can be **deferred** or simplified if they are not strictly necessary for a minimal viable demonstration.

6. **Next Steps & Validation**  
   - Outline a **plan for testing and validating** each newly implemented feature (unit tests, integration tests, manual checks).  
   - Mention ways to **track progress** (Git issues, Trello, a simple Markdown checklist, etc.) and keep the architecture doc updated.

**Desired Output:**

- A **condensed report** or structured plan (could be bullet-pointed or in a short document form) that:
  1. **Summarizes** the current state of the `feature/mcp-interface` code.  
  2. **Identifies** gaps between the codebase and the target architecture.  
  3. **Recommends** a prioritized roadmap for alignment and **optional** suggestions for iterative improvements or simplifications.

**Key Goals**  

- Ensure the final outcome is a **practical** roadmap (not just theoretical).  
- Keep the focus on **aligning with the architecture doc** in a local, non-production environment.  
- Maintain a **learning-oriented** approach, clarifying which areas will give the most insight into building advanced RAG + code intelligence systems.
