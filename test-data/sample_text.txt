# Sample Text Document for Testing

This is a sample text document used for testing the chunking and validation functionality of the HADES-PathRAG system.

## Introduction

Text documents are a common format for storing information. They can contain various types of content, including:

1. Plain text
2. Structured text with headings
3. Lists and enumerations
4. Code snippets

## Processing Text Documents

When processing text documents, the system should:

- Extract the content
- Identify any structure (headings, lists, etc.)
- Chunk the content appropriately
- Validate the chunks against the schema

## Sample Code

Here's a sample code snippet that might be found in a text document:

```python
def process_text(text_content):
    """Process text content and return chunks."""
    chunks = []
    paragraphs = text_content.split("\n\n")
    for i, paragraph in enumerate(paragraphs):
        if paragraph.strip():
            chunks.append({
                "content": paragraph,
                "index": i,
                "type": "paragraph"
            })
    return chunks
```

## Conclusion

Text documents are versatile and can contain a mix of content types. The chunking system should be able to handle this variety and produce meaningful chunks that preserve the semantic meaning of the content.

This sample document includes multiple paragraphs, headings, lists, and a code snippet to test various aspects of the chunking system.
