# [DEPRECATED] PathRAG Fork Repository

## ⚠️ REPOSITORY DEPRECATED ⚠️

**As of May 25, 2025, this repository has been deprecated. All active development has been moved to the standalone [HADES](https://github.com/r3d91ll/HADES) repository.**

## Transition to HADES

This repository began as a fork of the PathRAG project but has since evolved substantially beyond the scope of the original project. The HADES project (Hierarchical Adaptive Document Embedding System) builds upon PathRAG's foundation but implements significant architectural improvements including:

- Advanced ISNE (Inductive Shallow Node Embedding) technology
- Comprehensive document processing pipeline
- Semantic chunking with Chonky integration
- ArangoDB storage implementation
- ModerBERT embedding support
- Extensive testing and benchmarking infrastructure

## Why We Moved

The decision to migrate from this fork to a standalone repository was made for several reasons:

1. **Project Scope**: The extent of our modifications and enhancements significantly exceeded the original PathRAG project's scope and purpose
2. **Repository Clarity**: Maintaining a clear separation between the original PathRAG and our HADES implementation
3. **Risk Management**: Preventing accidental upstream contributions to the original project
4. **Project Identity**: Establishing HADES as its own distinct system with a clear identity and purpose

## Finding the Active Project

All active development, issues, and discussions should be directed to the main HADES repository:

- GitHub: [r3d91ll/HADES](https://github.com/r3d91ll/HADES)
- Documentation: See the `docs/` directory in the main repository

## Historical Context

This fork served as the development foundation for HADES from its inception until May 2025. We appreciate the original PathRAG project's contributions that helped make HADES possible.
